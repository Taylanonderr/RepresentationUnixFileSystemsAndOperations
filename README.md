# RepresentationUnixFileSystemsAndOperations

In this project, I coded the representation unix file system using the c and c ++ languages.
Problem is designing a file system that uses i-nodes blocks and data blocks to keep my files. Posix
file system operations and information are realized by simulating the ways of access and use.
